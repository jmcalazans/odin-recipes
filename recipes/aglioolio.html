        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Garlic Oil:</strong>  While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant and just starting to turn golden, about 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to let the garlic burn.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Garlic Oil:</strong> Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic oil. Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the oil. If the pasta seems too dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
        <li><strong>Season And Garnish:</strong> Season the pasta with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Stir in the chopped parsley, reserving some for garnish if desired. Toss everything together until well combined.</li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the aglio e olio pasta to serving plates or a large serving dish. If desired, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top and garnish with additional chopped parsley and lemon zest for extra flavor.
